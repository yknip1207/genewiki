#   ProteinBoxBot v0.9   #
==========================
== Introduction ==
ProteinBoxBot is a Java program to automatically update
the infoboxes on GeneWiki pages. It also includes utilities
for automatic code generation of article stubs and infoboxes
for users to create their own Gene Wiki articles.

For more information, see the bot's userpage at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot
or visit the GeneWiki project portal at

ProteinBoxBot v0.9 was developed by the Su Lab at The Scripps
Research Institute, 2011. It is maintained by eclarke@scripps.edu,

=== Installation ===
System requirements:
  1. Java JRE 1.6 or higher
  2. PyMOL (for image rendering module)
Installation procedure:
  1. If desired, install PyMOL on the local
     host to enable protein structure image
     rendering and upload. If you do, note the
     path of the PyMOL binary.
  2. Run ./setup.sh to interactively set up
     the bot.properties file as well as the
     logging database (SQLite) and appropriate
     directory structure.

=== Running ProteinBoxBot ===
ProteinBoxBot can be run in one of two ways:
Using main menu:
  1. In the directory containing the jar file,
     execute the command:
       java -jar ProteinBoxBot.jar
  2. Select desired operation from the menu.
Using command-line arguments:
  1. Execute the command:
       java -jar ProteinBoxBot.jar [args]
     where [args] consist of the following options:
     resume   - selects ids that have not been updated from db
     restart  - clears updated status of all ids and starts from
     	      	scratch
     ids      - prompts for specific ids to update
     init     - re-initializes database (disabled)
     help     - prints help message

=== Notes, Known Bugs, and Future Improvements ===
1. 	The cache options in the bot.properties file have no effect and 
	will be removed in the future.
2. 	There is no method to automatically generate a list of Gene Wiki
	pages to populate the database. This file was created by hand in
	the past but a method to generate it automatically will be available
	soon. The API query to generate a list of templates is here (one line):
		http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=embeddedin&
		eititle=Template:GNF_Protein_box&eilimit=15000&einamespace=10
	and a list of pages is likewise available by changing the einamespace
	field to 0 instead of 10.
3.	Logging to stdout is inconsistent at best- the best way to monitor
	progress is by watching the SQLite database.
4.	Code generation utilities are not available through the main entry
	point at ProteinBoxBot.main() and require building a jarfile using 
	the GeneWikiUtils.main() method.
