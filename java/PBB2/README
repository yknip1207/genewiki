#   ProteinBoxBot v0.9   #
==========================
== Introduction ==
ProteinBoxBot is a Java program to automatically update
the infoboxes on GeneWiki pages. It also includes utilities
for automatic code generation of article stubs and infoboxes
for users to create their own Gene Wiki articles.

For more information, see the bot's userpage at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ProteinBoxBot
or visit the GeneWiki project portal at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:GeneWiki.

ProteinBoxBot v0.9 was developed by the Su Lab at The Scripps
Research Institute, 2011. It is maintained by eclarke@scripps.edu,

=== Installation ===
System requirements:
  1. Java JRE 1.6 or higher
  2. PyMOL (for image rendering module)
  3. Pywikipedia (for more robust image uploading routines)
Installation procedure:
  1. If desired, install PyMOL on the local
     host to enable protein structure image
     rendering and upload. If you do, note the
     path of the PyMOL binary.
  2. Download pywikipedia and run the configuration utility
  	 to set it up with an account on commons.wikimedia. The 
  	 bot will attempt to log in using pywikipedia when it
  	 goes to upload the rendered image file.
  3. Run "java -jar install.jar" to interactively set up
     the bot.properties file as well as the
     logging database (SQLite) and appropriate
     directory structure. This also downloads
     the appropriate gene2pubmed file, does a quick
     overview scan of the GeneWiki, and initializes the
     databases with the gathered information. This step
     can take quite some time.
  4. Updates to protein boxes can be conducted through 
  	 ProteinBoxBot.jar, and code generation utilities
  	 can be accessed through GeneWikiCodeGenerator.jar.

=== Running ProteinBoxBot ===
ProteinBoxBot can be run in one of two ways:
Using main menu:
  1. In the directory containing the jar file,
     execute the command:
       java -jar ProteinBoxBot.jar
  2. Select desired operation from the menu.
Using command-line arguments:
  1. Execute the command:
       java -jar ProteinBoxBot.jar [args]
     where [args] consist of the following options:
     resume   - selects ids that have not been updated from db
     restart  - clears updated status of all ids and starts from
     	      	scratch
     ids      - prompts for specific ids to update
     init     - re-initializes database (disabled)
     help     - prints help message
     
=== Running GeneWikiCodeGenerator.jar ===
GeneWikiCodeGenerator is a command-line only utility.
Run java -jar GeneWikiCodeGenerator.jar without arguments to see
usage description.

=== Notes, Known Bugs, and Future Improvements ===
1. 	The cache options in the bot.properties file have no effect and 
	will be removed in the future.
2. 	Bootstrap functions are a work-in-progress.
